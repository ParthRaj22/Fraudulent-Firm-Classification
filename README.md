# Fraudulent-Firm-Classification
Goal of this research is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis of present and historical risk factors.

There are two csv files to present data. Merged these two datasets into one dataframe. Considered Audit_Risk as target columns for regression tasks, and Risk as the target column for classification tasks.
